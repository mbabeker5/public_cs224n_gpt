ne eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
Thine eyes, on thy heart, and mourners be,
Have put on black thy heart, and mourners be,
Thine eyes, and on thy heart, and mourners of heart,


Thine eyes, and on thy heart; and, on thy heart, and mourners,
Thine eyes, and pity on thy heart; and, on thy heart's eyes, and mourners,
Thine eyes, and on thy heart's eyes, and mourners,
Thine eyes, and thy heart's eyes, and mourners,
Thine eyes, and thy heart; and

For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
For my friend to me it gives me to groan,
For to my friend, it gives me to groan
For that wound it gives to my friend.
For to me it gives me to groan,
For to my friend, it gives me rest
For that wound it gives me to groan.


For that wound it gives me rest it gives me,
For that wound it gives me rest it gives me,
For that wound it gives me rest it gives me,

And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,

And that is thy will, that I will forfeit mine,
And that is thy will, that I will forfeit mine,
And that is thy will which I forfeit,

u blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
They know what is and where it is,

They know what is and where it resides,
They know what is and what is not,
They know what is and what is not,
They know what is and what isn,

They know what is and what doesn
They know what is and what is not
They know what is and what is not
They know what is and what they know
They know what is and what is not
They know what is and what is not
They know what is

n my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
That I might, though she know my love,
I love her, though she know my love is untutored
I love her, though she know my love is untutored,
That I might, though she know my love is untutored
I love her, though she know my love is untutored, *I love her, though she know my love is untutored
That I love her, though she know my love is untutored
That I love her, though she know my love is untutored
That she, though she know my love is untutored,

That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;

O, to my heart thy heart my heart my heart, my heart the heart
O' the heart, my heart the heart the heart,
O this thy heart the heart, my heart the heart
O, my heart the heart, my heart the heart,
O, my heart the heart, my heart the heart
O, this thy heart the heart, my heart's heart's heart,
O, my heart the heart,' the heart's heart's heart's heart

wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
My sorrow, not with words, and words too cruel
My sorrow, not with words, and words too cruel
My sorrow, not without words, and words too cruel
My sorrow, not without words, and words too cruel
My sorrow, not without words, and words too cruel
My sorrow, not without words, and words too cruel

faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
For I do not in thee a thousand errors;
For mine eyes in thee a thousand errors,
For I do not in thee a thousand errors,
For I do not in thee a thousand errors,
For I do not in thee a thousand errors,
For I do not in thee a thousand errors,
For I do not in thee a thousand errors,

e is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
O, but of thy own sin,
O, but of my own hate, on my own hate,
Hate of my hate, on my hate,
Hate of my hate, hate of my hate, hate
O, but of thy hate, on thy hate, hate, hate,
Hate of my hate and hate thy hate,
Hate of my hate and hate thy hate, hate of my hate, hate
O, but of thy hate, on thy hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Hate and hate, but of thy hate and hate, hate

 as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
One to her, to catch her, to catch her all,
Sets her down, and makes her to her,
Sets her down to her, and makes her to her all,
Sets her all to her, and makes her all to her all
Sets her all to her, and makes her all to her all
Sets her all to all, and makes her all to all
Sets all to all, and makes her all to all
Sets all to all, she all, and makes her all
Sets all to all, and makes her all all
Sets all
